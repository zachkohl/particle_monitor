# Particle Monitor

This was part of the Rubicon Sensors project that I mention in my resume. 
While the more complete application was completed in Python, this is a quick and dirty NodeJS app that uses socket.io to update the browser everytime a specific webhook is accessed. 


The sensor system would work through Particle and their network to trigger the webhook. In this case the sensor was detecting water flow rates from an ultrasonic module. 

The project itself was very hardware intensive and invloved a lot of soldering in my basement. I have a ton of pictures if you are curious.
